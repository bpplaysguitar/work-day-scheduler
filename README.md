## Description
This workday scheduler taught me how tricky it can be to learn to use local storage, but how useful it is once I got the hang of it. I can see a many places where I'd want to utilize this. It was also my first time working with Luxon for time, and that is a neat tool as well. I wasn't aware anything like that even existed. Also quite powerful and I'm sure I have not even scratched its surface. It was nice to see how a couple new tools could come together to build something so familiar and seemingly simple.
